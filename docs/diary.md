# The diary — reference plan

**Status:** decided 2026-09-17 after a full design review. This is the
reference for building. Supersedes `todo-capture.md` (deleted) and the
"agent side" sketches in `student-os.md`, whose open questions are resolved
here. Nothing below is built yet unless a phase is ticked in `plan.md`.

## What it is

A blank page inside the Omarchy shell where a student writes the day, and an
agent that reads it and answers in the margin. Sessions and deadlines are
features inside that page. The shipped timer and deadline work is the
structured layer underneath.

Built for one student first, installable by others later. Hard dependencies:
Omarchy and opencode. The student brings one model key. Every path (vault,
daily folder, curriculum folder, agent folder) lives in one config file, never
in code, and the vault path is never recorded in this public repo.

## Principles

1. **Agentic-first.** Plain files plus one command. No daemon, no API, no auth.
2. **The note is the student's, the store is the system's.** The daily note is
   written by the student, only ever by the student. Structured facts (due
   dates, status, subject) live in the store the CLI already owns. When they
   disagree, the store wins and the agent may flag it.
3. **Consent is an allowlist, enforced locally.** The model sees exactly what
   local code assembled: today's note minus private blocks, the agent's own
   knowledge files, the curriculum folder, the timer report. Nothing else on
   disk, ever. Every payload is logged before inference, so "the private block
   was not sent" is a test, not a promise.
4. **Never out of nowhere.** The agent runs only when the student acts in the
   page. It may be proactive *inside* that moment — surface an observation, a
   missed task, an opportunity — but it never notifies, never schedules itself.
5. **Speak with evidence.** Every observation or suggestion carries the
   evidence it rests on. "Two sessions on DORO, none on the seminar paper due
   Friday" is allowed. "Time to study" is not.
6. **Design to become less needed.** Dismissing a suggestion is memory: the
   same point is not raised again unless the evidence changes. Success is
   commitments met and self-initiated sessions, never time in the page.
7. **One device is enough.** No relay, no server, no second machine in the
   loop. Syncthing may exist on the machine; it is not part of the design.
8. **Rich on the surface, plain underneath.** The page may be as polished as
   we like, but the note stays GFM markdown plus callouts, readable by git,
   Obsidian, and the agent alike.
9. **The agent reads everything it is allowed, produces nothing submittable.**
   Questions, plans, observations, proposals. Never an essay.

## Files

All paths relative to the vault unless stated. Names of folders are config.

| What | Where | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Today's note | `inbox/Daily/YYYY.MM.DD.md` | the student, through the page |
| Day transcript | `agents/student/daily/YYYY.MM.DD.md` | the runner |
| Day state | `agents/student/daily/YYYY.MM.DD.json` | the runner, rendered by the page |
| Knowledge | `agents/student/knowledge/` | the runner; the student may edit |
| Curriculum | folder named in config | the student; read-only for the agent |
| Deadlines, sessions | `~/.local/state/omarchy-student/` (existing) | the CLI only |
| Payload log | `~/.local/state/omarchy-student/payloads/` | the runner; never synced |
| Cost ledger | `~/.local/state/omarchy-student/cost.tsv` | the runner |

**The note.** Created from a template by whoever gets there first (page or
Obsidian); both check for existence. The template is one line: a link to the
day's transcript, `[[agents/student/daily/YYYY.MM.DD|agent]]`, unresolved until
the first reply creates it. No code path except create-if-missing ever writes
this folder. The page is the one program that edits the note, and only because
the student typed or ticked in it.

**The transcript.** For the student. One section per block: the quoted block,
the reply, proposals as checkboxes, and the dive-in dialogue if there was one.
Cost of each run in the section header.

**The state file.** For the page. Per block hash: state (`seen` | `reply`),
reply text, proposals, opencode session id, timestamps. Plus the day's
suggestions. Not pretty; the page renders it.

**Knowledge, three kinds only.** `profile.md` (who the student is, courses,
how they want to be spoken to); `subjects/<name>.md` (deliverables, what is
going on, dismissed suggestions); `patterns.md` (intention→outcome record,
observed habits). A file whose purpose the agent cannot state does not exist.

**Curriculum.** Student-provided course material. PDFs are converted to
markdown once on arrival by local code, so payloads are always text and always
logged. Always in the allowlist.

**Store additions.** `deadlines.tsv` gains `subject` and `link` columns. A
project *is* a subject; milestones are simply deadlines under a subject. No new
record type. Sessions gain an optional `--for <deadline id>` on `pomo start`.
An unlogged session is never treated as neglect — group work goes unlogged, and
that is fine — only as something to ask about.

## Blocks

A block is a paragraph or a list item with its indented children, identified
by a hash of its text. No ids are written into the note. Editing a block makes
it new and unprocessed, which is the honest behaviour. Block splitting is a
pure function shared by the page and the runner.

**Private.** A `> [!private]` callout hides a block. Frontmatter `agent: false`
hides the day. Both are removed by local code before the payload is built.

## The loop

**Triggers, all from the page.** No file watcher.
- a completed checkbox line (`- [ ] …` followed by Enter)
- a completed line starting with `@`
- a completed line ending with `?` (journaling questions fire too; accepted)
- a tick (`[ ]` → `[x]`)
- opening the page (one pass; nothing written if nothing changed since last)

**Run.** The page saves the note and calls the runner with the block that
fired. The runner:
1. builds the context from the allowlist, strips private blocks, writes the
   payload log;
2. runs `opencode run` with a dedicated agent that has **no tools** — the
   permission block denies everything — with DeepSeek 4.1 flash via OpenCode
   Go, one config line;
3. receives one structured message: reply text, proposals, knowledge updates,
   suggestions;
4. applies it locally: appends to the transcript, updates the state file,
   writes knowledge files, records cost;
5. exits. Nothing is resident between runs.

Adding tools later is one line in the agent definition; starting without them
is what keeps the audit trail complete and reversible.

**What a fresh checkbox produces.** A proposal to the deadlines panel when the
line carries a date or a known subject; one question when it lacks both;
never silence. Ticking a proposal makes local code run `pomo deadline add`.
The model never touches the store.

**What a tick produces.** Possibly a follow-up: a grade reminder, a cross-check
("what about x and y, did you deliver those?"). Possibly nothing.

**Never** asks about unticked boxes. The open-checkboxes panel is the reminder.

**Suggestions.** Found during any run: upcoming tasks, late tasks with a
deadline, recently added tasks without one, opportunities in the curriculum.
Evidence attached. Shown in the page only, never as a notification. Dismissal
is written to knowledge.

**Dive-in.** A plain chat about one block, continuing that block's opencode
session (`--session`), persisted into the same transcript section. May produce
the same proposals as a reply.

**Cost.** No caps at first. Every run's cost and tokens go to the transcript
and the ledger; limits are decided from usage, not guessed.

## The page

- A Quickshell panel in `omarchy-shell`, full screen, summoned by a Hypr key.
  Fully bound to the Omarchy theme, the way `student.pomo` and
  `student.deadline` already are. No Chromium.
- Today's note only. No hierarchy, no file tree. A blank page.
- Save after every keystroke, coalesced over ~300 ms, flushed on Enter and on
  close. Escape closes.
- Blocks painted from the state file: **faded** means seen, a **marker** means
  a reply is waiting. Keyboard navigation between blocks; a key dives in.
- Open-checkboxes panel: every unticked box across daily notes, last seven
  days open, older collapsed. Ticking there edits the original line (the page
  is the one writer). Merges with the deadlines popup once both exist: a task
  with a date and a task without one are the same thing to a student.
- Suggestions panel: the day's suggestions with evidence, dismissable. Same
  "what's next" view as the checkboxes.
- Class notes taken during the day go in their own files, linked from the
  note. The agent reads a linked note only when an `@` line points at it.
- Sessions: pick a deadline when starting, or don't. The agent may propose one
  from the last checkbox line.
- Checkboxes replace the post-session keystroke from `student-os.md` D3: a
  checkbox line is the intention, the tick is the outcome.

## Modes (later)

- **Companion** — the page as above.
- **Focus** — full screen, timer as the frame, the agent quietly facilitates.
- **Study** — the drill pattern from the exam system (an outside assessor
  scores, the student never rates themself), as a mode of the same page.

## Acceptance tests

- Typing a line that ends in `?` and pressing Enter produces a reply marker on
  that block in under a minute. Typing a plain line produces nothing.
- A block inside `> [!private]` is provably absent from the payload log. A
  day with `agent: false` produces no payload at all.
- No file under the daily folder is ever opened for writing by the runner
  (asserted by test, not convention).
- The opencode agent has no tools: a payload that asks it to read or write a
  file yields text only.
- Each run's cost appears in the transcript and the ledger.
- Nothing is resident between runs.
- Suspend mid-run: the run completes or is retried on resume; no trigger lost.

## Phases

1. **The page** — Quickshell panel, today's note, plain text, per-keystroke
   save, Hypr key, theme-bound. Block splitting as shared code. No agent.
2. **The loop** — runner with allowlist and payload log, tool-less opencode
   agent, transcript and state file, triggered by the page. The allowlist and
   no-write tests ship in the same phase. `subject` and `link` on deadlines,
   `--for` on sessions.
3. **The overlay** — faded and reply-waiting states, block navigation, dive-in
   as a plain chat continuing the block's session.
4. **Proposals** — tick to execute, deadlines with subject and link, conflict
   flagging, the open-checkboxes panel.
5. **Knowledge** — the three file kinds accumulate, intention→outcome from
   checkboxes, suggestions with evidence and remembered dismissals, curriculum
   folder.
6. **Rendering** — headings, checkboxes, private callouts drawn properly in
   the page.
7. **Focus mode.**
8. **Study mode.**
9. **Phone capture**, then **external reading** (portal deep links, reading
   time estimates, suggested slots, interpretation questions). Last, gated,
   read-only.

## Decisions log

- 2026-09-16: pivot from todo app to daily note; consent per block; cloud
  model via opencode; laptop only.
- 2026-09-17: full review. Own editor in the shell, not Obsidian (blank page,
  no hierarchy). Page comes first, loop second. Agent never writes the note;
  one template link is the only touch. Editor is the trigger, no watcher.
  Signals: checkbox, `@`, `?`, tick, page open — never a schedule. No tools
  for the model; structured reply applied locally. DeepSeek 4.1 flash via
  OpenCode Go. Allowlist replaces "human/ default private": `human/` is
  simply not on the list. Store wins over note. Project = subject, milestones
  = deadlines. Sessions optionally attach; absence is never evidence. Unticked
  boxes go to a panel, never to a question. Suggestions with evidence, shown
  in page only, dismissals remembered. No cost caps until usage is known.
  Syncthing and the Mac are out of the design. Phone and study mode later.
